      "content": "A classic question!\n\nThe sky appears blue to our eyes because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere. Here's why:\n\n1. **Light from the sun**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it consists of all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n2. **Molecules in the air**: The atmosphere is filled with tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n3. **Scattering occurs**: When light encounters these small molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting:\n\n4. **Blue light dominates**: Since blue light has a shorter wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers) than other colors, it gets scattered more efficiently by the small molecules in the air. This means that more blue light is distributed evenly throughout the atmosphere.\n5. **Our eyes perceive it as blue**: When we look at the sky, our eyes are primarily sensitive to the wavelengths of light that are scattered most effectively â€“ namely, blue and violet. Our brain interprets this blue light as the color of the sky.\n\nSo, in summary, the sky appears blue because:\n\n* Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum.\n* The small molecules in the air scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more efficiently than other colors.\n* Our eyes are sensitive to this scattered blue light, which dominates our perception of the sky's color.\n\nThis is why the sky typically appears blue during the daytime, when the sun is overhead. At sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering even more of the shorter-wavelength blue light, which makes the sky appear more red or orange."
